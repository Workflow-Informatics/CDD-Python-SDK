# Installation

To install, run the following in a Git terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Workflow-Informatics/CDD-Python-SDK.git
cd CDD-Python-SDK/
python setup.py install
```
***
# Getting Started

1. Import the `VaultClient` module:

```python
from cdd.VaultClient import VaultClient
```
2. Confirm your [User Permissions](https://support.collaborativedrug.com/hc/en-us/articles/214359023-Vault-User-Roles), then instantiate a VaultClient to work with your data:
```python
vaultNum = 4598 # Insert your unique vault ID here.
apiToken = os.environ["cddAPIToken"] # Insert your API token here.

vault = VaultClient(vaultNum, apiToken)
```

3. Use the provided methods and properties to download, upload, and edit data:

```python
projects_dataframe = vault.getProjects() # default response is pandas dataframe
protocols_json = vault.getProtocols(asDataFrame=False)

filtered_protocols = vault.getProtocols(projects = projects_dataframe.at[0, 'id'])
```

4. A full list of valid parameters can be returned by passing  `help=True`
```python
vault.getMolecules(help=True)
```
***


# VaultClient Attributes

`self.URL` Returns the URL assciated with the active VaultClient instance

`self.vaultNum` Returns the four-digit vault ID associated with the active VaultClient instance

`self.apiKey` Returns the API Key associated with the active VaultClient instance

`self.maxSyncObjects` Returns the current value of the maxSyncObjects attribute


# VaultClient Methods
*Note: Additional methods are defined for VaultClient, but are not intended to be called by the end-user. However, developers are encouraged to check the docstrings within those methods.*


## Control/Misc.

### Set the vault ID and construct the base URL, from which endpoints for all subsequent API calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) will be constructed.
```python
setVaultNumAndURL(vaultNum)
```

__Returns__: `tuple` a two-element tuple consisting of the vault ID and the base URL for accessing the CDD Vault API.  

---
### Set the API token credentials, which will be passed in the request header to CDD Vault with each API request. 
```python
setAPIKey(apiKey)
```
	Note that the API token must have read/write access to the vault specified by the vault ID when executing the various API calls or an error will be returned.
 
__Returns__: `str`

---
### Set the 'maxSyncObjects' attribute, which is used to determine when a synchronous vs asynchronous export request is submitted to CDD. If the # of objects returned from a GET request is ever `>=` maxSyncObjects, the call will be repeated asynchronously.
```python
setMaxSyncObjects(value=1000)
```
	Defaults to 1000, the maximum # of objects which a CDD GET request can return synchronously.

Only used in methods where GET requests can be performed asynchronously: 
	
	Molecules, Batches, Plates, Protocols, and Protocol Data. See method sendSyncAndAsyncGets().
__Returns__: `int`


## Batches

```python
getBatches(asDataFrame=True, help=False, **kwargs)
```
 * __asDataFrame `bool`__ returns the json as a Pandas DataFrame.

```
 * __slurps `bool`__ If True, the id parameter will be interpreted as a [slurps ID](https://support.collaborativedrug.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005685526-Slurps-Post-i-e-Bulk-Import-of-Data-via-Files). Specifies the slurp_id of an import operation. The user must have [appropriate permissions](https://support.collaborativedrug.com/hc/en-us/articles/214359023-Vault-User-Roles) to remove ALL runs in the slurp.
		
		All runs associated with the slurps ID will be deleted. 
		
		If user permissions are insufficient, no runs will be deleted.
 
 * __id `str` or `int`__ unique id for an existing readout row object in CDD Vault.


## Slurps

### Bulk import endpoint for programmatic use. [CDD Support Topic](https://support.collaborativedrug.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005685526-Slurps-Post-i-e-Bulk-Import-of-Data-via-Files)
```python
postSlurpsData(fileName, project, mappingTemplate=None, runs=None, interval=5.0)
```
	Uses an existing mapping template to map the data in the import file into CDD Vault.
	
	Once a file has been uploaded through the API, data from the import is committed immediately unless there are errors or warnings.
	
	Any import errors or warnings (Suspicious Events) will cause the import to be REJECTED.

 * __project `str` or `int`__ Required. Either the name or id of a single project. To use a project name, enter a `str`. To use a project id, enter an `int`.

 * __mapping_template `str` or `int`__ The name (`str`) or id (`int`) of a mapping template that matches the attached file. If you choose to exclude this keyword:
 
 		CDD will attempt to use an existing template that matches the import file.

		If none of the templates in your vault match, the import will be REJECTED

		If more than one of the templates in your vault match, the import will be REJECTED
 
 * __runs `dict`__ Optional. a single run detail object which will be applied to all new runs present in the file. Valid Keys:
 ```json
"run_date": use YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss:hh:mm. Default is today’s date.
"place": This is the 'lab' condition in CDD. No default.
"person": default value is user's full name.
"conditions": no default value provided.
```

## Batch Move Jobs

### This endpoint requires the user to be a vault admin

### Retrieve the statuses of one or more batch move jobs from CDD Vault queue.
```python
getBatchMoveJobs(self, batchMoveJobID=None)
```	

 * _batchMoveJobID `int` or `str`_ Optional. The unique ID of the batch move job to retrieve. If `None`, retrieves all jobs in the queue.

### Create a new batch move job to move a batch to a different molecule in the same vault.
```python
postBatchMoveJob(self, data=None)
```

 * _data `JSON`_ Required. Valid Keys:
```json
"batch": Unique integer ID of the batch to move. Required.
"molecule": Unique integer ID of the molecule to move the batch to. Required.
"name": A new name for the batch. Optional. Only allowed
      for vaults without a registration system.
"fail_on_molecule_deletion": Fail if moving the batch would trigger the removal
			   of the originating molecule. Default true.
```

### Cancel a single batch move job in the queue
```python
deleteBatchMoveJob(self, batchMoveJobID)
```
 * _batchMoveJobID `int` or `str`_ Required. The unique ID of the batch move job to retrieve.

#### NOTE: Once a job has started it cannot be deleted. Also, if you are moving the highest batch of a molecule, the batch number it previously occupied will be reused by the next batch of the original molecule.
